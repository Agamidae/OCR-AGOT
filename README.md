# OCR AGOT
A compatibility patch for OCR Support and A Game of Thrones mods for Crusader Kings 3.

You need all three mods and the base CK3 game. DLCs are optional.

[Visit OCR Support wiki if you haven't used it before.](https://github.com/Agamidae/CK3-OCR/wiki/)

AGOT mod is still in development and only has Westeros, but in a lot of detail, with more than a thousand counties.

There is also only one start date, Robert's Rebellion.

# Load order

The mods in your playset must be in this order:

1. A Game of Thrones
1. OCR Support
1. OCR AGOT

You can change it by removing mods from the playset and adding them again, in the correct order.

Consider making a new playset so you can switch to the normal version of the game without disabling mods.

# Installation

## Steam

Subscribe to the mod on Steam and add it to the bottom of the playset, after AGOT and OCR Support.

## Manual installation

Unzip the archive and place OCR-AGOT folder and OCR-AGOT.mod to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod

Create mod folder if it doesn't exist.

When updating, you'll only need to replace the OCR-AGOT folder.

## Git

If you're familiar with git, clone the repo to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod and use the default OCR-AGOT name for the new folder.

Then copy OCR-AGOT Git version.mod to the \mod folder. It links to OCR-AGOT/OCR-AGOT, so if you rename the folder, change the path in this file too. You'll only need to copy it once.
